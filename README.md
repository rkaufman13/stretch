# Local dev

`npm start` has been modified to start the firebase emulator suite. If the emulator suite is not installed on your local machine, you will probably get some sort of error. Please install the emulator suite following the instructions [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/install_and_configure).

Once the app is running on localhost:3000, you should be able to trigger a login by clicking the button and creating any user in the resulting popup.
